title: Null Adapter for BizTalk
---

I have written a blog post about the free [Null Adapter](http://blog.integrationsoftware.se/null-adapter-keep-it-clean/) for BizTalk.
It is really a helpful adapter in some scenarios. 

It is posted on [Integration Software's blog](http://blog.integrationsoftware.se).

Cheers!
